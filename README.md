üåê Blue-Green Deployment Strategy
This project uses the Blue-Green Deployment strategy by leveraging Azure Web App Deployment Slots:

The application is deployed to the stage slot first (green environment).

After validation, traffic can be swapped to production slot (blue environment) via manual or automated slot swap.

This approach minimizes downtime and allows for quick rollback in case of failure.
